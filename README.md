This project explores an insurance dataset to analyze the impact of various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region on medical charges. It also calculates insurance premiums based on a custom formula and visualizes key trends using SQL and R.

The project follows a structured ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and Analysis approach:

Data Cleaning: Handling duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Creating BMI and age categories.
Data Analysis: Understanding the relationship between different factors and insurance charges.
Premium Calculation: Implementing a formula to estimate insurance premiums.
Visualization: Using ggplot2 to present insights.

Key Insights:

Smokers have significantly higher medical charges and premiums compared to non-smokers.
Higher BMI leads to higher charges, reinforcing the link between obesity and health risks.
Age is a strong factorâ€”older individuals tend to pay higher insurance premiums.
